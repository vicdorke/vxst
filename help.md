# Help Needed: Trans women in China Keep Dyin

As a transgender woman in China, I am facing a life-threatening situation that is putting my existence and well-being at risk. In December of last year, the Chinese government banned access to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) [1] [2] [10], resulting in the deaths of several dozen trans women[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. A website [11] has been created to document some of their stories after they passed away.

In just the realm of my knowledge, from January 1st 2023 to now, 58 transgender individuals have lost their lives, averaging out to one person every day. The extent of my knowledge is limited to those who had a Twitter account or were active on QQ. On Twitter, there have been 21 confirmed deaths among transgender individuals, and in my other social circles, mainly on QQ, there have been 37 confirmed deaths. This is an unprecedented and devastating loss of life, and it is heartbreaking to think about the countless others who have suffered and passed away beyond the scope of my knowledge. These individuals were someone's friends, family members, and loved ones, and their loss is a profound tragedy that must not be ignored.

The reality is that transgender individuals in China are being **erased**, and deaths are happening at an alarming rate *RIGHT NOW*. As a transgender woman myself, I am experiencing these difficulties firsthand and am in dire need of help and protection from both the government and my own family.

The situation is beyond critical, and I implore the international community to take action and offer support in our fight for survival. **Every day**, more and more members of our community are losing their lives, and it is crucial that we receive support and assistance from those whoever can help.
