# Help Needed: Transgenders in China Keep Dying

As a transgender woman in China, I am facing a life-threatening situation that is putting my existence and well-being at risk. In December of last year, the Chinese government banned access to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) [1] [2] [10], resulting in the deaths of several dozen trans women[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. A website [11] has been created to document some of their stories after they passed away.

In just the realm of my knowledge, from January 1st 2023 to now, 58 transgender individuals have lost their lives, averaging out to one person every day. The extent of my knowledge is limited to those who had a Twitter account or were active on QQ. On Twitter, there have been 21 confirmed deaths among transgender individuals, and in my other social circles, mainly on QQ, there have been 37 confirmed deaths. This is an unprecedented and devastating loss of life, and it is heartbreaking to think about the countless others who have suffered and passed away beyond the scope of my knowledge. These individuals were someone's friends, family members, and loved ones, and their loss is a profound tragedy that must not be ignored.

The situation for transgender individuals in China is dire, with ongoing erasure of lives and increasing deaths happening right now. The government's **persecution and discrimination** against this community is unacceptable and must be addressed immediately.

As a member of the transgender community, the dire situation is all too familiar and highlights the urgent need for help and protection. Every day, Chinese transgenders, including myself[12], are facing threats and losing lives. It is imperative that the international community takes action and offers support in our fight for survival. The loss of so many lives is a tragedy that cannot be ignored, and it is imperative that action is taken to support us from this ongoing persecution.

All we ask for is only a chance to live.

> 我会保证至少每7天阅读一次邮件，包括使用S/MIME和GPG加密的邮件；对于GPG加密的邮件，由于私钥只存在于不可仿造，多重备份并且可以自毁的硬件中，可以确定只会由我读到。对于S/MIME，几乎只会由我读到，除非发生了严重的意外事件。

> 如果有条件，建议使用GPG发送邮件，并且使用以上链接提供的公钥。如果我在28天内没有回复GPG加密的消息，或者回复的消息没有有效的签名，你可以认为我已离世或遭受严重意外。对GPG加密的消息，我必然会在回复时使用F085D7C448667DEF签名。如果收到了回复的消息，但没有使用F085D7C448667DEF签名，很有可能不是我本人发送的邮件。注意我不会接收由国内邮件提供方发送的邮件，例如QQ邮箱，网易邮箱和新浪邮箱等，由于我公开邮件地址并且会阅读每一封邮件，如果允许这些提供商发送的邮件进入收件箱，收件箱会被广告堆满，因此不得不进行高度严格的垃圾邮件过滤。

> 我会百分百地收到所有以“@gmail.com”，“@outlook.com”或“@zju.edu.cn”结尾的邮件，并且会完整阅读。
>
> 对于GPG，可以视为经过F085D7C448667DEF签署的一切内容都是我本人的内容。除非已经公开使用销毁证书销毁了这个key，我会对经过F085D7C448667DEF签署的所有内容负责。
