## Hi, I'm Jyn Spring (Chunqing Shan) 👋 这里是琴春哦

> Stay fortitude, Do good, Be excellence: 永远坚强，永远善良，永远卓越

#### Skills

* Advanced algorithm and mathematics
([Rk.27 in National Olympiad in Informatics 2012](https://bytew.net/OIer/?query=UID4470)), PR/ML
* High-performance computing, [broke the world records of HPL and HPCG](https://www.hpcwire.com/2016/04/20/asc16-zhejiang-university-sets-new-student-cluster-linpack-record)
* Full stack development and full stack deployment

#### Contact

* Email：me@vx.st / shantingst@gmail.com, Telegram：[@thevxst](https://t.me/thevxst), Mastodon：[@vxst@hub.mtf.party](https://hub.mtf.party/@vxst)

##### If you want more security
* SMIME: [smime_vxst.cer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/smime_vxst.cer) (It's not as secure as GPG, but at least the email provider can't read your mail. It's the preferred encryption method since I can access it on the go, and it's safe enough for most use cases)
  * You can always send me an email at me@vx.st, signed with your SMIME certificate, to request my signed reply, which will establish a trust tunnel for the future. This process is very easy with iOS/Apple Mail.
* GPG: [F085D7C448667DEF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/48667DEF.asc) (Fingerprint: F2A1 B804 3905 5888 0DFE  BBA0 F085 D7C4 4866 7DEF)
  * Since my GPG secret key only exists within hardware tokens, I'll need a computer to decrypt the message. You'll wait more time before a reply (once a week), but this method is literally unbreakable.
