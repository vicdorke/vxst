# Canary Statement

A mechanism to test for unsafe conditions, originating from the use of canaries in coal mines to detect poisonous gases or cave-ins. If the canary died, it was time to get out of the mine. More recently, the term has been used by some online service providers to refer to an affirmative statement, updated regularly, that the provider has not been subjected to certain legal processes. If the statement is not updated in a timely fashion, users may infer that the canary statement may no longer be true.

I confirm that I am still alive. I don't think I have an imminent threat that will happen in a few days. I don't think I'm in a safe state and there's no guarantee of my life due to the clan and local government's murder plan against me.

But I am still alive. For now.

This canary will be re-signed every month between 1st and 15th after August 2022. If one of the canary fails to be signed and published, you can safely assume I am dead.
