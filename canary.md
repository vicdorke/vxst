# Canary Statement

A mechanism to test for unsafe conditions, originating from the use of canaries in coal mines to detect poisonous gases or cave-ins. If the canary died, it was time to get out of the mine. More recently, the term has been used by some online service providers to refer to an affirmative statement, updated regularly, that the provider has not been subjected to certain legal processes. If the statement is not updated in a timely fashion, users may infer that the canary statement may no longer be true.

# The Canary

Hash: SHA384

I confirm that I, Chunqing Shan, or vxst, am alive.

My "ZongZu"(clan, family) from Ningbo has made an open death threat to me.
There are about 170 men worldwide in my "ZongZu", and they agreed unanimously
to kill me. The reason for this death threat is because I am a transgender
woman, and it's considered to be unbearable to the clan, especially since my
father is the current "ZuZhang" (leader of a tradition) of the clan, and I was
their designated "ZuZhang" before my transgender identity is known to them.

They believe I seriously broke the "QiYun"(a kind of luck) of the clan and
the only solution is my death. They agreed that I should be killed even at the
cost of the lives of clan members.

I currently live in hiding, and I believe I'm safe in the short term since
there is a limitation on international travel placed by the Chinese government
due to covid-19, and I believe there is no active clan member knows my
address.

I will continue to live in hiding until I can reach a safe country that can
protect me from the murder (not only the justice after the murder, they are
determined that they don't care about that).

This canary will be re-signed every month between the 1st and 5th after August
2022 with the GPG key with the following primary key fingerprint:

F2A1 B804 3905 5888 0DFE  BBA0 F085 D7C4 4866 7DEF

This key can be fetched from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/48667DEF.asc

This canary will only end due to my death, or I have got to a safe place. I
will sign a statement using the same key if the latter happens.

Time of this canary's signuture: 2022-11-05
Next time of signuture: 2022-12-01 to 2022-12-05, inclusive.
