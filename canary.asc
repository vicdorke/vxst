I confirm that I am still alive. I don't think I have an imminent threat that will happen in a few days. I don't think I'm in a safe state and there's no guarantee of my life due to the clan and local government's murder plan against me.

But I am still alive. For now.

This canary will be re-signed every month between 1st and 15th after August 2022. If one of the canary fails to be signed and published, you can safely assume I am dead.
