I confirm that I, Chunqing Shan, or vxst, am alive.

My "ZongZu"(clan, family) from Ningbo has made an open death threat to me.
There are about 170 men worldwide in my "ZongZu", and they agreed unanimously
to kill me. The reason for this death threat is because I am a transgender
woman, and it's considered to be unbearable to the clan, especially since my
father is the current "ZuZhang" (leader of a tradition) of the clan, and I was
their designated "ZuZhang" before my transgender identity is known to them.

They believe I seriously broke the "QiYun"(a kind of luck) of the clan and
the only solution is my death. They agreed that I should be killed even at the
cost of the lives of clan members.

I currently live under some protection. I am unsure if it will continue to
keep me safe, but as long as it does, I believe I am secure. This unique
circumstance has caused a delay in the signing process.
